// ============================================================================================================================================
// 🧩 Fragment stage of the object-selection outline: a fullscreen composite that reads the R32_UINT visibility buffer and draws an outline exactly
//    where the SELECTED partition ordinal borders a pixel that is NOT that ordinal. Nothing else is read — no depth texture, no second geometry
//    pass, no stencil. The id buffer was written under hardware depth test, so each pixel already names the partition NEAREST the camera there;
//    an outline derived from it is therefore depth-correct by construction.
//
// 💡 THE DEPTH BUG THIS AVOIDS. The naive outline re-draws the selected object with front-face cull / a scaled hull / a jump-flood over its
//    silhouette, then composites that ring over the frame. That ring is built from the object's OWN extent with no knowledge of what occludes it,
//    so an unselected object standing in front of the selected one gets the ring painted ON TOP of it — the selection reads as being in front of
//    geometry that actually occludes it. Sorting the draws does not fix it (the ring is not the object), and testing the ring against depth only
//    trades it for a second artefact: the ring vanishes wherever it touches the silhouette's own depth discontinuity.
//    Reading the resolved id buffer removes the failure at the source. A pixel belongs to the selected object here ONLY if the selected object won
//    the depth test at this pixel. An occluder in front simply owns those pixels, so no border is ever detected there and the outline is silently,
//    correctly clipped by the occluder — the same rule Blender's overlay engine relies on.
//
// 📝 Border rule: the pixel is INSIDE when its partition == SelectedPartition. It is an outline pixel when it is inside and at least one neighbour
//    within OutlineThickness is NOT inside (an INNER outline: the ring lands on the object's own pixels, never on its neighbours'). An inner ring is
//    what keeps the outline honest — an outer ring would have to paint pixels owned by whatever is behind/beside the object, which is exactly the
//    occlusion lie above. Empty pixels (the all-ones sentinel) are never inside, so an object silhouetted against sky outlines against the sky.
//
// ⚠️ THE ID BUFFER ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH, and this is the bug the depth tap below fixes. "My neighbour is a different ordinal" is TWO different
//    situations wearing one signal:
//      • the neighbour is sky or sits BEHIND me  → a true silhouette edge, outline it;
//      • the neighbour sits IN FRONT of me       → an OCCLUSION CONTOUR, and outlining it traces the occluder's shape onto my surface.
//    Selecting a large background object (the floor) made that unmistakable: every head standing on it got ringed, because the floor pixels hugging
//    each head satisfy "inside AND neighbour differs". Those really are floor pixels — nothing was painted over an occluder, the earlier inner-ring
//    rule held — but an outline is meant to say "here is my outer boundary", not to trace every hole punched in me. Depth is the only thing that
//    separates the two cases, so the neighbour test now also compares depth.

//    For each differing neighbour we ask whether it is NEARER than us:
//      • nearer  → it occludes us; this stretch of our boundary is HIDDEN behind it   → OutOccluded
//      • farther → it is sky or sits behind us; this is our true silhouette           → OutVisible
//
// ⚠️ THE DECISION IS PER-NEIGHBOUR, NEVER PER-KERNEL, and both blunt versions of this rule are broken in opposite directions:
//      • "visible wins if ANY neighbour is not-nearer" → the original bug. Where a head stands ON the selected floor, the contact pixels sit at nearly
//        the same distance as the floor beneath them, land inside the slack, and count as not-nearer — so one contact pixel re-lights the whole
//        occlusion contour and every head gets a solid ring.
//      • "occluded wins if ANY neighbour is nearer"    → the opposite failure. On a curved silhouette almost every boundary pixel has SOME nearer
//        differing neighbour within the radius, so the solid ring collapses to dashed everywhere and the selection highlight disappears.
//    What actually matters is the DIRECTION each differing neighbour lies in. A neighbour that is sky or sits behind us proves our boundary faces open
//    space there → that stretch is genuinely visible. A neighbour that is nearer proves only that THAT direction is blocked. So the two flags are
//    accumulated independently over the kernel and both may end true; the blend site then prefers solid, which is now correct because OutVisible means
