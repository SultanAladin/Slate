// ⭐ THE SELECT TOOL MUST PICK THE KIND OF ELEMENT THE ARTIST ASKED FOR.
//
// 🔴 It picked whatever won a fixed priority — point, then control, then curve — so reaching for an EDGE
//    with a vertex sitting anywhere near it returned the vertex instead, and whether the artist got what
//    they meant depended on how far the view happened to be zoomed. Measured on a line with a probe three
//    units from an endpoint and one unit from the edge through it, the unrestricted search returns the
//    Point every time.
//
// 🔴 A MODE THAT MERELY PREFERS ITS ELEMENT IS THE SAME DEFECT WEARING A HAT. If `Vertex` fell back to a
//    curve whenever no vertex was in range, the artist would still be guessing which kind they were about
//    to get. Claim ③ is the one that matters: a miss must be a miss.
