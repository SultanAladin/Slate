//============================================================================================================================================
// 🧩 Rounds or cuts the corner where two curves of a world sketch meet — the 2D fillet and chamfer.
//
// 🔴 A CORNER IS NOT A CURVE, AND IT IS NOT A POINT EITHER. It is the JUNCTION of two curves that share an
//    endpoint, and it only exists while both of them do. That is why this unit names a corner by the two
//    curves that form it rather than by an index into something: an index into a loop's traversal is
//    invalidated by the very operation that fillets it, and an index into a point list cannot say which
//    of the several curves meeting there the artist meant.
//
// 🔴 IT DOES NOT REQUIRE A LOOP. The retired `ProfileCorner` could only round a corner of a RESOLVED
//    PROFILE LOOP, so two loose lines sharing an end -- an L, the most obvious thing an artist would try
//    to fillet -- had no corner at all as far as it was concerned. A junction is a junction. Whether the
//    curves happen to close into a loop decides whether the result can be filled, and nothing else.
//
// 🔴 THE CLAMP IS PART OF THE OPERATION, NOT A GUARD AROUND IT. A fillet eats `Radius / tan(θ/2)` off each
//    leg, so a radius large enough to eat more than a leg is long does not "fail" -- it asks for
//    something no geometry can express. `ResolveCornerLimit` answers the largest radius the corner can
//    take, so a drag can be held at the limit and the artist sees the fillet stop growing rather than
//    the tool refusing them with nothing on screen.
//
// 📝 Straight legs only, for now. Both curves at the junction must be lines; a line meeting an arc is a
//    tangent problem with a different construction, and answering `UnsupportedGeometry` for it is honest
//    where quietly rounding it against the chord would not be.
