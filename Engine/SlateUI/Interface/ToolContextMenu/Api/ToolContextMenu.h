//============================================================================================================================================
// 🧩 The small readout an operation raises while it is being dragged — the fillet's radius, the chamfer's
//    setback — showing the figure live and taking an exact one back from the keyboard.
//
// 🔴 IT IS THE SAME FIGURE THE DRAG IS SETTING, NOT A COPY OF IT. `Rows` point AT the tool's own datum
//    and are written through, so typing 12.5 while dragging and then dragging again continues from 12.5.
//    A popup holding its own copy would have to be synchronised every frame, and would drift the first
//    time somebody forgot.
//
// 🔴 IT IS PINNED TO THE BOTTOM-RIGHT, NOT ANCHORED TO THE GESTURE. The retired version placed itself in
//    whichever corner was free relative to the thing that raised it, so it MOVED between operations and
//    sometimes between frames of the same one -- and the artist had to go and find it. A readout the eye
//    can return to is worth more than one that follows the pointer, and a readout under the pointer is
//    covered by the very thing being dragged. It still refuses to overlap the widgets it is told about,
//    but it steps aside by moving UP, keeping the right edge, rather than hopping corners.
//
// 🔴 IT IS SMALL. The retired popup was 260 px wide with a 44 px head, a 52 px foot and 44 px rows -- a
//    third of a viewport to ask for one number. This is a compact readout: one caption line, one value,
//    and the parameter rows that actually vary. Apply and Cancel are on it because a drag that has been
//    released has to be confirmable without going back to the pointer.
//
// 🔴 IT LOOKS LIKE THE SELECT TOOL'S OPTIONS. It draws through the SAME `OptionControlPalette` the
//    options widget uses, so a slider here is the same slider there, by construction rather than by two
//    people drawing the same thing twice.
