//============================================================================================================================================
// 🧩 The fillet/chamfer gesture: hover a corner, press, drag out a radius, release to apply — with the
//    figure the artist is dragging published every frame so a popup can show it and take a typed value
//    back.
//
// 🔴 THE DRAG IS THE PRIMARY CONTROL AND THE POPUP IS THE SAME NUMBER. They are not two ways to set a
//    radius that have to be kept in step; there is ONE radius, held here, and both the pointer and the
//    keyboard write to it. Anything else drifts the moment the artist drags after typing.
//
// 🔴 THE CLAMP IS SILENT, NOT A REFUSAL. Dragging past what the corner can take holds the radius at the
//    limit and keeps drawing, exactly as Plasticity does. A tool that stops drawing past some invisible
//    threshold reads as broken; a fillet that visibly stops growing reads as a limit.
//
// 📝 This unit is pure: no ImGui, no device, no panel. It takes a probe point and a pointer state and
//    answers what the sketch should look like — which is what lets it be proven headlessly.
