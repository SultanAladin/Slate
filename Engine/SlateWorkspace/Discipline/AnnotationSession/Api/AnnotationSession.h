//============================================================================================================================================
// 🧩 The gestures that place dimensions and apply constraints: pick what to measure, drag it off to the
//    side, type an exact figure.
//
// 🔴 A DIMENSION IS PLACED IN ONE DRAG AND EDITED FOREVER AFTER. Picking the geometry declares it at its
//    measured value, so it always starts out true; the drag only decides where it sits. That ordering
//    matters -- a dimension that appeared with a made-up value would move the drawing the instant it was
//    created, which is the opposite of what an artist expects from an annotation.
//
// 🔴 TYPING A VALUE GOES THROUGH THE SOLVER, NEVER STRAIGHT INTO THE GEOMETRY. Writing the parameter
//    directly is simpler and always "succeeds", but it cascades unpredictably -- edit one edge of a
//    triangle and the neighbouring edge silently changes length too -- and it cannot tell you when the
//    sketch has been over-constrained. The solver can refuse. A refusal that leaves the drawing alone is
//    worth far more than a write that quietly produces something nobody asked for.
//
// 🔴 CONSTRAINTS COMMIT ON THE LAST PICK, NOT ON A BUTTON. A constraint has no figure, so it needs no
//    readout and no Apply -- it needs exactly as many picks as its subject demands, and it applies the
//    moment it has them.
//
// 📝 Pure, like every other session here: picks and pointer positions in, intent out. No ImGui, no
//    device, so the whole thing is provable headlessly.
