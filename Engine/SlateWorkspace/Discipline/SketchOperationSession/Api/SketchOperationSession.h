// 🧩 The gestures for Cut, Trim, Extend, Offset and Fill — the operations that are driven by pointing and
//    clicking rather than by dragging out a figure.
//
// 🔴 THEY ARE NOT ALL THE SAME GESTURE, AND PRETENDING THEY WERE IS WHAT WOULD MAKE THEM FEEL WRONG.
//    Cut, Trim, Extend and Fill each act on ONE CLICK and have no figure to set, so they perform on
//    release and raise no readout — a popup asking Apply for a click the artist has already made is a
//    second confirmation of a decision already taken. OFFSET has a figure, so it drags, clamps and holds
//    a readout exactly as the fillet does. The shape of each gesture follows from whether it has a number.
//
// 🔴 EVERY ONE OF THEM PREVIEWS BEFORE IT COMMITS. Hovering reports what WOULD happen — which curve would
//    be trimmed, where an extend would land, whether a cut point is even on the curve — so the artist
//    sees the result before pressing. The preview and the commit ask the same function, so they cannot
//    disagree.
//
// 📝 Pure, like `CornerDragSession`: a probe point and a pointer state in, an intent out. No ImGui, no
//    device, no panel, so the whole gesture is provable headlessly.
