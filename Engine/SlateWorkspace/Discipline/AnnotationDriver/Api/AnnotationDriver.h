//============================================================================================================================================
// 🧩 The arm that turns a pointer in a viewport into a dimension or a constraint, and raises the readout
//    for the one that carries a figure.
//
// 🔴 THE TOOL SUBJECT IS TRANSLATED IN EXACTLY ONE PLACE. Fourteen catalogue tiles map onto six dimension
//    subjects and eight constraint subjects, and if that mapping existed at more than one site the two
//    would eventually disagree about what "Tangent" means. Everything below reads `AnnotationIntent`.
//
// 📝 Same shape as `SketchOperationDriver`: the session beneath is pure and takes world points, the
//    pointer arrives in pixels, and casting the ray happens once here.
